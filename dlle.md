# What is Dall-E 2? 

DALL-E 2 is a really cool computer program that can create pictures of things that don't exist in the real world.

It works by taking a written description of an object or scene, and then using a special type of artificial intelligence called a "neural network" to generate an image that matches the description.

For example, if you wrote a description of a "purple cat with butterfly wings and a unicorn horn," DALL-E 2 would use its neural network to create an image that shows exactly what that would look like!

It's a very advanced program that scientists and artists use to explore the limits of computer-generated art and imagination.


# How Does It Work?

DALL-E 2 works by using a special type of artificial intelligence called a "generative model," specifically a "neural network."

The neural network is trained on a huge dataset of images and text descriptions. During the training process, the neural network learns how to associate certain words or phrases with certain visual features or patterns.

Once the neural network has been trained, it can generate new images based on text descriptions it has never seen before. When given a new description, the neural network uses the patterns it learned during training to generate an image that matches the description as closely as possible.

To make this happen, DALL-E 2 uses a lot of computing power and sophisticated algorithms that analyze and manipulate the images and text descriptions in real-time.
